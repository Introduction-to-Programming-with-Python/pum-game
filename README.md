# Pum game

A simple game with Python.

## Objectives

This project aims to apply the following functionalities:

- Practice While cycle.
- Practice conditionals

## How does it work?

Once you execute the file [Code.py](https://github.com/Introduction-to-Programming-with-Python/pum-game/blob/main/Code.py) you will see in the console two columns, the first column has numbers and the second column too, but in som cases the word "pum".

The game consists in: there is a number of players and each player should say one number starting in one, the second player two and the thirht three, if a player say a number divisible by the x number, that player lost.

By default, the parameters are the following:

- 3 players
- The number x is 5
- The players will count to 20

If you want to change the parameters:

- Number of players: change the first parameter of the function, replace 3 by the number you want in line 26
- The x number: change the second parameter of the function, replace 5 by the number you want in line 26
- The maximum number to count: replace 20 by the number you want in line 9
